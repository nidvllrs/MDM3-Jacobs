# MDM3_Jacobs

This repository includes the code and files used for the report. 

Under CSV outputs, there are outputs of the different codes as CSV files.

timetable_tiploc_crs_node_matching_final.csv matches the IDs to the name of the stations. For example, railn_53 corresponds to Bristol Temple Meads. 

rail_network.csv maps the nodes to their geographical coordinates.

Disruptions_model.py models the disruptions caused by an input edge. 'manchester_ids.csv' and 'edge_flows_1.csv' are required in the same path to run model for Manchester. An example of running the code is included in lines 272-289.
